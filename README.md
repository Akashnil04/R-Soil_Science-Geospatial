\R – Soil Science \& Geospatial Analysis



This repository contains \*\*R-based workflows for soil science analysis integrated with geospatial techniques\*\*.  

It is developed for academic, research, and applied studies in \*\*soil fertility, spatial variability, and precision agriculture\*\*.


The repository is intended to document reproducible methods combining \*\*soil data analysis, GIS, and remote sensing\*\* using R.
